# Baruch_CIS_Project0
This was my first project in my CIS 2300 "Programming and Computational Thinking" led by professor Sadat Chowdhury

This is my first project. It was designed to get me familiar with working on project assignments for the class and the submission process.

During the beginning of the semester, I filled an online sheet with a unique 7 letter word and a unique 5 digit number. For this project, I had to modify the main.py program to print the following: my unique 7 letter word, followed by a colon (:), followed by the highest digit in my unique 5 digit number. For example, if the word was "orchids" and the number is 12347, your program must output exactly this and nothing else:

orchids:7
